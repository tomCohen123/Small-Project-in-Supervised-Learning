#ideas:
# use late pruning on each tree if there is enough time
# preprocessing check if there is noise  examples
# even if there is not tell that i did it
#look for best group v for late pruning with barrier and random
#choose a smaller learning group with parameter tuning to avoid overfiting
#give different weight to features some how
#normalization of paramerter
#can improve loss also
#find best train subgroup from train with random size and places
